I had been studying in XMUM for about 4 years (which include one year in Foundation) and currently in my Year 3 Last semester, which means I still have one last year in University (if everything went smoothly üòÇ). In this blog post I will be basically sharing my experience and my honest feeling about this Degree in a few perspective, environment, module structure, lecturer and more.

# Background

I had enrolled in Bachalor in Software Engineering in XMUM since year 2018 and my estimated graduation period is about July 2022. Yes you are right, something special here in XMUM is that our Bachelor in SWE is a 4 year program (rathar than 3 years program like almost all other universities in Malaysia). I do asked some authority before why it is 4 years in XMUM for Bachalor in SWE, but the only answer I get is that they are follows our main campus which is Xiamen University in China.

## Does 4 years worth it?

Rather than usual 4 years in other university, it cost 4 years in our university. Therefore, I often asked by juniors/friends on does it worth it? As it takes one more than than others. So I would like to analyze my opinion/thoughts/facts below for people who are curious about it.

### Cost

- You would need to fees for 4 years rathar than usually 3 years from other university.
- If a university offers 3 years program with cost of 28k per year (Eg. [APU](http://www.apu.edu.my/our-courses/undergraduate-studies/school-computing-technology/bsc-hons-software-engineering)), it will cost about 3 x 28k = 84k.
- For XMUM, it offers 4 years program with cost of 25k per year, it will cost about 4 x 25k = 100k.
- Therefore, compare to other university with almost same price point, it is more pricy and might not worth your penny if you mainly cares on the fees.
- Even compare with other university with higher fees but offers 3 years module, the fees for whole degree is also almost the same. (EG 3years x 35k is almost same as 4years x 25k )
- However, there are lots of scholarship and financial aids that are provided by the university, and it is pretty generous too. There are 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% scholarship waiver.
- üë®‚Äçü¶± (Personal Opinion): I feel that if your main consideration is the fees paid (I believe most of us did), this might not be a very good choice as surely will be more costly than other university with almost same yearly fees.

### Module

Personally, as a student (I am surely biasüòÖüòÖüòÖ), I didn feel any competitive advantage for studying one more year than other university. I also feel we had study lots of repetitive course throughout the 4 years.
I just couldn't convince myself why I would need to study for the extra year.
(More detailed review will be discussed below)

## Environment

### University environment

The university environment is pretty good, the university is beautiful, there are lots of place to jalan-jalan and the view at night is pretty good

### Classmates

Most of the students here are actually scholarship holder as there are generous. You can have a look [here](http://www.xmu.edu.my/2017/1208/c16278a320627/page.htm), they are pretty awesome.
We have 3 intakes per year. Which are February, April and September.
For my intake, September intake
