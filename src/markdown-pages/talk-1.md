On the 19th of October 2020, I was invited by XMUM Software Engineering Student Union to share my thoughts on advice for Software Engineering Program Freshman.

### 1. Learn the basics (first year)

During the first year of the program, it may be very dry, since that most of the things we learned are very basics and lots of them are quite theoritical.

However it would be good if you learn the basics well.

This is because lots of courses in SWE are actually require some basics skills u learned from freshman year.

- Understand the basics could help in further studies

### 2. Seek for help when needed

Dont stuck at a problem too long → although it is good to actually discover problem ourselves, but dont stay too long. Seek for help when needed

- Ask lecturer → send email book appointment
- Ask seniors
- Ask friends
- GOOGLE!!!!!
- Stackoverflow
- Github issues
- Learn to debug
- Ask friends/lecturer

### 3. Do not assume lecturers to teach you everything → Self Learning

Not like secondary school → which your teachers actually spoonfeed you with the knowledge you should know or to excel in exam

Lecturers only have limited time to teach you guys → 15 weeks they could not cover everything → so sometimes u may found out that your assignments difficulty level will be quite different from your learnings → lecturers may assume you to do some self learning and research

Tech stack teach in University quite outdated / different from the industry ⇒ learn yourself since you had the knowledge and basics before hand

And also you must have the mindset of keep on learning → as tech field is a keep evolving field

### 4. Ask your seniors (get some tips from them!!) ⇒ dont repeat their mistakes

Sometimes counselors can only do so much to help guide you through your academic career. Sometimes, the best advice comes from those who are going through or have been through the same things as you: your peers. Ask them about their experiences, and you can benefit from their wisdom! They can also help you plan out your classes, share tips on which classes to avoid, and give you emotional support as well. I wish I had talked to other students about which classes best suited my needs, before putting so much time and money into them. Even though I didn’t get this advice as soon as I would have liked to, I eventually caught on and was able to get really helpful technical interview tips by going straight to my peers.

### 5. Learn to work in a team

When I was first learning about computer science, the stereotype of the lone person coding in a cubicle appealed to me. However, it’s not accurate. While you will spend some time on your own, working on your laptop, you’ll also spend time in meetings, discussing what you’re working on, and with other programmers, dividing up work and helping each other when you run into issues with your code. About a fifth of my projects in college have been team-based, and in a class I’m taking this semester, every project is team-based. You’ll likely be working with other programmers throughout your career. So, remember to work on improving your communication skills.

### 6. Networking

- Inspiration
- Advice
- Motivation

know you have probably already heard about how important networking is, but it really is that important! From recruiters to professors to even your peers, everyone has valuable advice and can support you and your career goals in different ways. Networking can help you improve your skill set, gain resources for your career development, and even introduce you to potential mentors. You never know where your next big opportunity could come from so focus on building good relationships with others. My network has opened me up to so many opportunities I never would have discovered otherwise, and I even got my full-time job through networking!

### 7. Explore different field in the Tech Industry
