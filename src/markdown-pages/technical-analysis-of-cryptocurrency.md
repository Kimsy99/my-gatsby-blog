# Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency

Recently, I have been obsessed with cryptocurrency and also my University final year project is a Data Science & Machine Learning Project that are related to cryptocurrency. In this project it require me to have some knowledge in technical analysis to complete this project.
Therefore here are some notes from my study of technical analysis in cryptocurrency.

## What is Technical Analysis

Technical analysis is basically using existing, past data from the cryptocurrency/stock market to predict the where it will go next. It may allow you to forecast whether the project will bearish (trending down) or bullish (trending up). By knowing that, it allows us to know when the market is low (so that we can buy in low price) and high (sell when high price) to gain profit.

> TA uses past data to forecast the future.

However it is not confirmed that TA forecast is 100% accurate as it is impossible to know what will happen in the future especially with the cryptocurrency market (as it is extreamly volatile, affected by media, influencer, giant whales, governemnt, banks).

## Technical Analysis in Cryptocurrency

### Candlestick

When you are looking at at realtime cryptocurrencies charts like [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en), you will see vertical bars with green/red/pink colors. But do you know what does it meant?

**Gap between rectangle**

- shows the gap between opening and closing balance for that coin during the period of time.
- so for and example the top edge is RM30000 and the bottom edge is RM25000, then the gap between them is RM5000.

**Color of rectangle**

- Red means value decrease, green means value increase
- If the rectangle is green, then the top edge of rectangle is closing price while bottom edge is open price, vice versa for red rectangle
- Green is good as the value of the coin increase (open with lower price but close with high price in market)
- Eg. within 1 hour (11pm to 12pm), at 11pm the price of the coin at that time is RM100 (this is the open price), while at 12pm the price of the coin is RM200 (this is close price). Then it will be a green rectangle with upper edge - RM200 and lower edge - RM100. Gap/rise of RM100.
- This is useful to show how volatile the market is within the period of time (can be 1 hour, 24 hour, 1 week or more).
- if the market is more volatile, it means that the marking is able to goes up or goes down alot within a period of time.

**Wick**
There are wick on the bottom of the chart. Shorter it is then is it suggest that people are selling the coin and vice versa.

### Volume

- Usually on the bottom of price chart
- It basically represent the volumn of sales, which is number of coins traded in a period of time.
- Usually, higher volume -> result in higher volatality.
- Usually we analyze it together with candlestock.
  - If volume of trades is low -> then usually less volatile, so there less likely to have large changes in price
  - If volume of trades is high -> then highly volatile, so there more likely to have large changes in price
