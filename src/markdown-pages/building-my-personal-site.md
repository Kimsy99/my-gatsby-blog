Months ago I had started to built my website using Gatsby. Initially I plan to create a simple blog for myself to express my ideas and also knowledge here. However eventually i feel like making it as my personal website to introduce myself and my works to others and at the same page there will still be a blog page for to to write my blogs.

Currently there are few pages in my personal site:

1. **Main page (index.js)** — Include information about me.
2. **About me page** — Include more detailed information about such as my interest, my projects, works and social medias
3. **Blogs** — for me to create blog post using markdown file and Gatsby will translate it into web pages (will describe in detail in later section)
4. **404 page** — displayed when there are error in loading pages
